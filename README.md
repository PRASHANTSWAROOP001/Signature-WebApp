# ✍️ Signature Canvas Project

Welcome to the Signature Canvas Project! This nifty little application allows users to digitally sign their name using HTML canvas. 🎨

## 🐞 Bug Fixes & Updates
We've squashed a bug where the signature and background were both black, making it hard to see. Now, the background turns white for better visibility and user experience. ✅

Additionally, we've implemented a date and time function to each signature, enhancing the authenticity and trustworthiness of each sign-off. 🕒
